  # TODO: thoroughly test usb redirection, it seems to work somehow without workarounds.
  #       are workaround are still needed?
  #         * udev rules and group membership for user?
  #         * an suid helper on the host and flatpak-spawn wrapper in sandbox? polkit?
  #         * polkit rules can't work in the sandbox, need to document all the polkit helpers, those
  #           probably should be available on the host with their polkit rules,
  #         * supply hardlinked binaries to run on the host? rules can be dropped into /etc
  #         * handling usbredirserver calls? or spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper from spice-gtk?

  # ssh configuration dir access, includes config, known_hosts, and etc.
  #   not xdg dirs spec compliant, so without the proper filesystem access permission the ssh
  #     configuration won't be saved between running sessions.
  #   enabled by default, if you don't like giving the sandbox this access then override it with
  #     flatpak-override or flatseal and add a `--persist=.ssh` to keep the ssh config dir in
  #     HOME/.var/app/org.virt_manager.virt-manager/.ssh
  #   using persist also means that the sandbox won't have access to your private key files so it
  #     won't be able to change them, if this is even something to be concerned about
  #     instead of giving access to the keys, give access to the ssh-agent
  #   i'm using a patched openssh build on the host to set the ssh config folder in .config/ssh so
  #     i'm forced to set `--persist=.ssh`

  # ssh-agent pid and socket
  #   access to the running ssh-agent on the host
  #   it's presumed that SSH_AGENT_PID and SSH_AUTH_SOCK are known in the sandbox, and that
  #     SSH_AUTH_SOCK is accessible in the sandbox
  #   the default, `--socket=ssh-auth`, bind-mounts the xdg-run/ssh-auth, only used by gnome-keyring's
  #     ssh agent but it's a good location as any to put the ssh-agent file socket
  #   if you're not using gnome-keyring's ssh agent then you gonna need to force your ssh-agent to create
  #     the socket in this mentioned dir, that you will also need to create before starting the app,
  #     or in another location, and then you should add the suitable filesystem permission.
  #     just make sure to only bind-mount an existing folder, and don't directly bind-mount the socket.
