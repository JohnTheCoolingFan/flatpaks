# flatpaks

A few Flatpaks that I hastly packaged. These are not thoroughly tested so use at your own risk!  
Packaging adapted mainly from the Flatpaks of Spotify and Flameshot, and Arch Linux's PKGBUILDs.

Not usable or too buggy ATM:

* Android File Tranfer
* MEGASync

Next to package:

* blueman
* bootnote
* caja with insync extension
* fcitx5
* joplin
* termite
